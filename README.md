## Aquatic Foods Nutrient Trade Exploration

#### This repository will continue to be updated with code to produce figures exploring international trade patterns of fisheries and fisheries-derived nutrients.

File structure:
- The _data_ folder has a readme with a link to datasets hosted on OneDrive (due to size constraints). Download the datasets and place them in your own data folder. All datasets here are pre-processed products resulting from merges of the Aquatic Resource Trade in Species database and the Aquatic Food Composition Database.
- The _code_ folder contains R scripts that calls the data.
- The _output_ folder contains figures stored in folders named after individual countries (e.g., "IDN") or a folder called "multiple_countries" for figures containing more than one country.
